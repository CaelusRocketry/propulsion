#  EXAMPLE 11:
#     (a)  Rocket problem with an infinite-area combustor (rocket).
#     (b)  Reactants are Li(cr) at 298.15 K and F2(L) at 85.02 K.
#          Enthalpies and "exploded" formulas are to be taken from
#          thermo.lib.  Thus this information is not given.
#     (c)  Relative amounts of reactants are given as moles.
#     (d)  Chamber pressure is 1000 psia (p,psia =1000).
#     (e)  Ionized species are to be included in the products (ions).
#     (f)  Only equilibrium calculations are to be performed (equilibrium).
#     (g)  For exit points, one pressure ratio (pi/p=68.0457), one 
#          subsonic area ratio (sub,ae/at=10), and three supersonic area ratios
#          (sup,ae/at=10,20,100) are to be included.
