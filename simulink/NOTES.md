# Simulink Notes

## Basics

`Gain`: Amplifying a value/signal; i.e. multiplying it by a value
`Dashboard scope`: An integrated scope into the canvas
`Stepping options`: To the left of the main `Run simulation` green play button, there is a `Stepping options` option that allows toggling of stepback, run interval, and pause time.
`Simulation data inspector`: On the `Simulation` tab, under `Review Results`, click `Data Inspector`. This stores data from all simulation runs.

## Tuning PID

Double click on the PID controller block, and there you can manually tune the PID parameters. In the bottom right corner, there is a button `Tune`, which opens up a menu for fine tuning. When finished in `Tune`, click `Update block` in the top right to update the block.

## Shortcuts

`Spacebar`: Fits the model to screen
`Right-click-drag` (a connection): Branches off a connection
`Shift-drag` (a block): Breaks off the block to allow more connections
`Left-click, type` (on canvas): Quick search for inserting blocks
